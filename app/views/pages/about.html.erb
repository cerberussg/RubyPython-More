<hr />

<p class="lead">All too often developers rarely communicate to clients throughout the development stage, resulting in a final product that fails to reach the goal sought by the customer and end user. For this reason I decided to utilize a few different development patterns that utilize highly focused communication and transparent design patterns.</p>

<p class="lead">When I take on a project not only do I work to craft the application according to the client's specifications. I give frequent and timely updates to ensure that the project is aligning properly with the client's goals. The end result is the right product, delivered on time, and on budget. </p>
